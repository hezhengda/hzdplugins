Welcome to hzdplugins's documentation!
======================================

This package is used for accelerating the computational procedure. It is developed based on `Aiida <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/>`_ and `pymatgen <https://pymatgen.org/index.html>`_.

If you have any issues with using the code, please file an issue on `Github <https://github.com/hezhengda/hzdplugins/issues>`_.

If you are interested in extending the functionality of the code, please contact me via this email (zhengdahe.electrocatalysis@gmail.com).

Enjoy computing, and enjoy building an automated world!
